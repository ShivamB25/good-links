In 2017, Instagram made substantial performance enhancements and cost reductions by disabling Python garbage collection, resulting in a 10% boost in efficiency. While this percentage might seem modest, it translated into significant savings when applied to their extensive server infrastructure. Instagram relies on Django and a master-worker process approach to maximize CPU resource utilization. They also adopted strategies such as worker restarts upon hitting specified memory thresholds to address memory leaks. Notably, shared memory between master and worker processes transitioned to private memory when workers modified data, achieved through a copy-on-write mechanism.

As for a GitHub README with a table format for adding new links later, here's a basic structure:

| Summary                               | Link                                      |

You can replace the placeholders (in caps) with actual URLs when adding new links. This table allows you to easily update and expand your references over time.
